# U.S. Medical Insurance Costs

An unguided Python project investigating a medical insurance costs dataset provided by Codeacademy in its *Data Scientist â€“ Natural Language Processing* Career Path. The dataset can be found under [insurance.csv](https://github.com/MarcoCamilo/U.S.-Medical-Insurance-Costs/blob/master/insurance.csv) in the files above.

To demonstrate a basic understanding of Python fundamentals, I'll be working with the information in the dataset and performing my own independent analysis. Skills to be demonstrated include:
- Working locally through Jupyter Notebooks
- Importing a dataset into my program
- Performing data cleaning and extraction for analysis
- Analyze a dataset by building out functions
- Use of libraries to assist in my analysis

Here are the of the questions I'll attempt to answer using this dataset according to different areas of interest:
- Demographics 
  - What is the average age of patients?
  - Are men and women equally represented in the dataset?
  - What is the age distribution of the sample?
- Insurance costs
  - What is the range of costs payed by patients in this dataset?
  - How much do women pay compared to men on average?
  - How much does smoking increase the cost of medical insurance?
  - Are there geographical differences in the costs for U.S. medical insurance?
